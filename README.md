Holo Video Labeler is a MATLAB app that allows for labeling individual frames in a video. The app was created to label cotton twists (convolutions/folds) found in videos of the z-stack of microscopic holograms of cotton fibers. This app was developed for the Applied Vision Lab at Texas Tech University.

It allows for the placement of bounding boxes around objects of interest in frames of .avi video files.

Warning: The app was not tested with videos larger than one hundred frames, since it was created for videos that are 31 frames long, representing the z-stack of a hologram.

## Running the Holo Video Labeler
To load short videos, either:
  
    1. Store the videos into the app's folder **_videos**
    OR
    2. Select folder containing short videos using the **select video folder**.
